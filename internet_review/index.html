    <h1>Invalid_Reviews: Internet Review</h1>
    <p>"Oh What a Time We Live In..."</p>
    <p>Starting out from a giant oversized piece of machinery to being able to fit in out pockets, the internet has found ways to reavel with us and how we travel with it. We have the ability to search what we want where we want at any time we want thanks to the internet. </p>
    <p>Some people have now used the internet more than all the rolls of toilet paper they have wasted throughout thier life. Many of us use it for education, for business, and sometimes as a distraction from the real world.  </p>
    <p>The internet was not a something we wanted, but it became something we needed. Throughout time, there has been a tendancy to connect all out accounts and all of out devices to an internet outlet making hackers vulnarable to our data. This leads into many issues with privacy, but in a world where privacy has become harder to gain, it may be worth the risk as the internet has given more than it deserves. </p>
    <p>I give it a 9.5/10
